# Breast Cancer Detection with Multi-Classifier Approach

## Overview
This project repository has been developed to feature a multi-classifier system for breast cancer detection using deep learning to classify mammographic images.

## Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine. Within, you will find the `RunMultiClassifier.ipynb`, the main executable notebook that runs the `MultiClassifier.ipynb` containing the multi-classifier logic.

## Data
Datasets used in this study are provided in two resolutions, 256x256 and 512x512. Access these via the shared Google Drive links and follow the directory structure specified in the notebook instructions.

## Model Weights
The highest performing model's weights are available for download. Use the link below to access them, and follow the notebook instructions to integrate them with the model.

## How to Use
Execute RunMultiClassifier.ipynb, which utilises MultiClassifier.ipynb.
Ensure the dataset is in the correct directory.
Load the downloaded model weights as instructed in the notebook.
